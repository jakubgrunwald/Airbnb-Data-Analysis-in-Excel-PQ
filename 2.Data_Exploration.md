In this chapter I aim to query the data with basic questions to understand its distributions and other characteristics. I'll accomplish it by loading the data directly to pivot tables. Other tables are in Connection only mode.

You can see general annual increase of the number of reservations. The most active months are February and March probably due to the seasonality. (It's summer in Australia then). There is a noticeable decline in Decebmer:

the number of reservations dropped down drastically just before Christmas.   

### Regions comparison
Let's find the most popular regions:

The table shows the domination of Hobart's.  

To **compare the reservations dynamics in different parts of the Island.** I choose Hobart to represent the southern part and Devontort as the north.

Twice a year there is a significant growth in the share of Devonport. This occurs to moments of reservations decline in Hobart. The Christmas drop effect does not apply to the nothern part.  

### Price dynamics  
Comparison of different categiories of property type can show me some dependencies in prices movement.

You can observe that the average prices move in opposite directions: Prices of B&Bs and tents peak during the low season and then declines sharply until the most active months. Villas prices rise naturally during the high season.
