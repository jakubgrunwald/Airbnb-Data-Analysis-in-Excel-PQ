In this chapter I aim to query the data with basic questions to understand its distributions and other characteristics. I'll accomplish it by loading the data directly to pivot tables. Other tables are in Connection only mode.

## Time-Series Analysis

You can see general annual increase of the number of reservations. The most active months are February and March probably due to the seasonality. (It's summer in Australia then). There is a noticeable decline in Decebmer:

the number of reservations dropped down drastically just before Christmas.   

### Regions comparison
Let's find the most popular regions:

The table shows the domination of Hobart's.  

To **compare the reservations dynamics in different parts of the Island.** I choose Hobart to represent the southern part and Devontort as the north.

Twice a year there is a significant growth in the share of Devonport. This occurs to moments of reservations decline in Hobart. The Christmas drop effect does not apply to the nothern part.  

### Price dynamics  
Comparison of different categiories of property type can show me some dependencies in prices movement.

You can observe that the average prices move in opposite directions: Prices of B&Bs and tents peak during the low season and then declines sharply until the most active months. Villas prices rise naturally during the high season.  

## Where to search for accomodation?  
By comparing the total number of reservations and the quantity of listings in each neighborhood, you can understand the demand and supply situation of Airbnb services.

The average occupancy ratio fluctuates from  54% to 88% in different locations. An interesting fact is the position of Hobart. Despite being the most popular destination, the total supply is significantly higher and there should be always an available Airbnb to stay in.  

## Does the price depend on the Superhost status and experience of the host?

It seems unusual that the highest prices are offered by hosts with no long experience. There is no strong relationship between Superhost status and price level.  

## Which hosts have are rated the worst?

The only group that stands out with the review score rating is those with up to two years of experience.  

## Are visitors satisfied by paying more?

Definately no. The worst average review score ratings apply to listings with highest average prices. Paying more is probably a reason for disappointment.  

## What room type is the more popular?

The market is dominated by entire apartaments and homes.
