# Data Analysis in Excel - Inside Airbnb: Tasmania
## Introdution
 Inside Airbnb is an watchdog site that scrapes and publishes data on milions of homestays that Airbnb operates every year. Aside from all the controversies on Airbnb's business model and its illegal character 
 the data seems perfect for analysis. This repo is dedicated to all Airbnb homestays in Tasmania in 2023. **The primary objective** of this project is to understand market dynamics: explore the distribution of 
 listings across different regions of Tasmania, identify pricing trends discerning popular tourist destinations. The conclusions of the analysis may prove useful for travelers, property owners and hosts, business 
 planning and researchers.

 The data is published quarterly so it's divided by [multiple CSV files](datasets)  

To put it all together I need to append and merge data from each table using Power Query. **Query schema:**
