# Data Analysis in Excel - Inside Airbnb: Tasmania
## Introdution
 Inside Airbnb is an watchdog site that scrapes and publishes data on milions of homestays that Airbnb operates every year. Aside from all the controversies on   
 Airbnb's business model and its illegal character the data seems perfect for analysis. This repo is dedicated to all Airbnb homestays in Tasmania in 2023.   
 It contains the process of data cleaning, building a query using MS Power Query, data exploration with visualisations and dashboard creation.
## Data description
 All the datsets are available on the [Inside Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data) The data used in this project is divided by 8 columns
