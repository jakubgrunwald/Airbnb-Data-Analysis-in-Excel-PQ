# 1. Listings
Listing.csv files contain glossary tables. Many rows representing various offers scraped from the website will repeat in each quarterly dataset so first I need to append all of them together and deduplicate at the end to include all offers that could appear during the whole period.

All these tables have the same structure so I can transform them comfortably using one **sample file**.

## Cleaning
At the beginning I need to check the data quality and define which columns will be useful. Here you can see some examples of low quality data

Many of them are totally empty or useless for this analysis. I remove columns that are functionally related or contain for example URLs, images, host details, long descriptions, amenties and many others. Number of columns is reduced to 15.  

#### Headers format changing
I want the headers to have each word capitalized and replace underscores with spaces. The fastest way to do that is to treat them as rows after transpose. That's the sequence of steps:

#### Other transformations of the sample file  
To make my data look better I need to:  
* Adjust data types
* Replace values from "t" to "TRUE" etc.
* Use Clean and Trim formulas to text columns
* Remove rows that contain empty IDs and duplicates

#### After combining the tables
When the appending is done properly, I can remove the source column and finally deduplicate the table. After that, the row count equals 7077 instead of 5577 in the sample file (Q1), indicating an increase of **1500 listings** across all of four quarters.  
**Final appearance of Listings**

# 2. Calendars
Calendar tables show room availability information based on reservations. When used correctly, they provide an accurate representation of service usage. I need to use another folder path.

These tables contain information about the availability of each listing as a time series.  

## Cleaning  

First, in the sample file I need to remove three columns that I find useless for the project aim.  
![image](https://github.com/jakubgrunwald/Inside-Airbnb-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-PQ/assets/159199366/5219ced7-51b9-4d3a-aafc-4608316dd292)  
In addition you can see that there are no low quality columns.  

#### Reducing file size  
Each calendar table contains over 2 million rows. Combining them would result in a significant slowdown. To reduce the size of data I can store only rows where the availability value is "t".  
![image](https://github.com/jakubgrunwald/Inside-Airbnb-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-PQ/assets/159199366/30d86a8c-96d6-44ba-8368-01b35e4afb39)   
As a result, the number of rows is halved and the table now exclusively contains reservation data. Now can I remove also the availability column.  

### Cause of duplication  

In these tables each row represents one reservation for a specific day. The data is published one year in advance every quarter. It causes many duplicates when an accomodation is reserved over 3 months before. To cope with this problem I need to deduplicate it using two key column: 'ID'and 'Date' **necessarily after appending**. To be able to compare periods, I have to exclude from the analysis reservations for extreme periods.

The final task before appending is to correct headers and adjust data type in each column. After combining I remove the Source.Name column.    


# 3. Tables merging  
The two appended tables are related by their Listing IDs. The final table should contain data on all reservations, including their prices and complete listing descriptions. Let's merge them as a new query.

I've chosen the calendar table as the left one, and I'm using the **Left Outer** Join to ensure that all homestays are included. Later, I'll run another query to see if there are any listings without matches.

To avoid duplicating columns, I don't expand Id and price.

#### Now the main table is ready for analysis.

#### Listings without matching.  
By creating an Anti Join I can see if there are any listings without matching stored in the glossary table. The order of the tables remains the same:

After columns **expanding** I can finally count rows. The number of listings withous matches is **436**. It's about 6% of all.
